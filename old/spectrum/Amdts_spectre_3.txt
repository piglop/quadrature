(4) This first programme should in particular support the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth given the huge potential of wireless services to promote an information-based economy, develop and assist sectors relying on information and communications technologies and overcome the digital divide. It is also a key action in the Digital Agenda for Europe which aims to deliver fast broadband internet in the future network-based knowledge economy, with an ambitious target for universal broadband coverage with speeds of at least 30 Mbps for all Europeans by 2020, thereby achieving the sustainable economic and social benefits of a digital single market. It should also support and promote other Union sectoral policies such as a sustainable environment and economic and social inclusion for all Union citizens. Given the importance of wireless applications for innovation, this programme is also a key initiative in support of Union policies on innovation.

(7) Ensuring the optimal use of spectrum may require innovative authorisation solutions such as collective use of spectrum, general authorisations or infrastructure sharing. The application of such principles in the Union might be facilitated by the definition of certain common or converging conditions for spectrum usage. General authorisations, which are the least onerous authorisation system, are of particular interest where interference does not risk hampering the development of other services.

Text proposed by the Commission
Amendment
(9) As underlined in the Digital Agenda for Europe, wireless broadband is an important means to boost competition, consumer choice and access in rural and other areas where deployment of wired broadband is difficult or economically unviable. However, spectrum management may affect competition by changing the role and power of market players, for example if existing users receive undue competitive advantages. Limited spectrum access, in particular when appropriate spectrum becomes scarcer, can create a barrier to entry for new services or applications and hamper innovation and competition. Acquisition of new usage rights, including through spectrum trading or other transactions between users, and the introduction of new flexible criteria for spectrum use can have an impact on the existing competitive situation. Member States should therefore take appropriate ex ante or ex post regulatory measures (such as action to amend existing rights, to prohibit certain acquisitions of spectrum rights, to impose conditions on spectrum hoarding and efficient use such as those referred to in Article 9 paragraph 7 of the Framework Directive, to limit the amount of spectrum for each operator, or to avoid excessive accumulation of spectrum) to avoid distortions of competition in line with the principles underpinning Article 5(6) of Directive 2002/20/EC (the "Authorisation" Directive) and Article 1(2) of Directive 87/372/EEC (the "GSM" Directive).

(10) Optimal and efficient spectrum use requires continuous monitoring of developments, and up-to-date transparent information on spectrum use throughout the Union. While Commission Decision 2007/344/EC on harmonised availability of information regarding spectrum use within the Community requires Member States to publish information on usage rights, a detailed inventory of existing spectrum use together with an effective review and assessment methodology are necessary in the Union to improve the efficiency of spectrum and radio equipment use, in particular between 300 MHz and 3 GHz. This would help to identify inefficient technologies and usages in both the commercial and public sectors, as well as unused assignments and sharing opportunities, and to evaluate future consumer and business needs.

(12) In line with the objectives of the Commission's flagship initiative "Digital Agenda for Europe", wireless broadband could contribute substantially to economic recovery and growth if sufficient spectrum is made available, usage rights are awarded quickly and trading is allowed to adapt to market evolution. The Digital Agenda calls for all Union citizens to have access to broadband of at least 30 Mbps by 2020. Therefore, spectrum that has already been designated should be authorised by 2012 for terrestrial communications to ensure easy access to wireless broadband for all, in particular within spectrum bands designated by Commission Decisions 2008/477/EC, 2008/411/EC and 2009/766/EC. To complement terrestrial broadband services and ensure coverage of most remote Union areas, affordable satellite broadband access could be a fast and feasible solution.

(12a) A European market with nearly 500 million people connected to high-speed broadband would act as a spearhead for the development of the internal market, creating a globally unique critical mass of users exposing all regions to new opportunities and giving each user increased value and the Union the capacity to be a world-leading knowledge-based economy. A rapid deployment of broadband is crucial for the development of European productivity and for the emergence of new and small enterprises that can be leaders in different sectors, for example health care, manufacturing and the services industry.

(12b) Mobile data traffic is increasing rapidly and is currently doubling every year. At this pace, which is likely to continue in the coming years, mobile data traffic will have increased nearly 40-fold from 2009 to 2014. This increase is to a high extent being driven by video, which will account for 66% of all mobile traffic in 2014. In order to manage this exponential growth, a number of actions will be required by regulators and market players including further harmonised spectrum allocations for wireless broadband, increased spectrum efficiency and offloading traffic onto wireless networks via dual-use devices .

(12c) The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has estimated the future spectrum bandwidth requirements for the development of International Mobile  Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000) and IMT-advanced systems (i.e. 3G and 4G mobile communications) as amounting to between 1280 and 1720 MHz in 2020 for the commercial mobile industry for each ITU region including Europe. Without the freeing up of additional spectrum, preferably harmonised at global level, new services and economic growth will be hindered by capacity constraints in mobile networks.

(13) The 800 MHz band is optimal for the coverage of large areas by wireless broadband services. Building on the harmonisation of technical conditions under Decision 2010/267/EU, and on Commission Recommendation of 28 October 2009 calling for analogue broadcasting to be switched off by 1 January 2012, and given rapid national regulatory developments, this band should in principle be made available for electronic communications in the Union by 2013. In the longer term, additional spectrum below 790 MHz could also be envisaged, depending on experience and the lack of spectrum in other bands adequate for coverage. Considering the capacity of the 800 MHz band to transmit over large areas, coverage obligations should be attached to rights.

Considering the capacity of the 800 MHz band to transmit over large areas, coverage obligations achieved through the principles of technical and service neutrality should be attached to rights. Additional spectrum for wireless broadband services in the 1.5 MHz band (1452-1492 MHz) and the 2.3 GHz band (2300-2400 MHz) should be freed up to meet the increasing demand for mobile traffic. Further mobile service spectrum allocations, such as the 700 MHz band (694-790 MHz), should be evaluated depending on future capacity requirements for wireless broadband services and terrestrial TV.

(13b) Increased mobile broadband opportunities are crucial to provide the cultural sector with new distribution platforms, thereby paving the way for a thriving future development of the sector. It is essential that terrestrial TV services and other actors be able to maintain existing services when an additional part of the spectrum is freed up for wireless services. Migration costs, resulting from the opening up of additional spectrum, may be covered through licence fees, making it possible for broadcasters to have the same opportunities as are enjoyed today in other parts of the spectrum.

(14) Since a common approach and economies of scale are key to developing broadband communications throughout the Union and preventing competition distortion and market fragmentation among Member States, certain authorisation and procedural conditions could be defined in concerted action among Member States and with the Commission.

Reflecting the importance of spectrum trading for increasing efficient use of spectrum and developing the internal market for wireless equipment and services, these conditions should apply to spectrum bands that are allocated to wireless communications, and for which rights of use may be transferred or leased.

(15) Additional spectrum may be needed by other sectors such as transport (for safety, information and management systems), R&D, public protection and disaster relief, e-health and e-inclusion. Optimising synergies between spectrum policy and R&D activities and carrying out studies of radio compatibility between different spectrum users should help innovation. The Commission's Joint Research Centre should help in developing the technical aspects of spectrum regulation, notably by providing testing facilities to verify interference models relevant to Union legislation. Moreover, results of research under the Seventh Framework Programme require the examination of the spectrum needs of projects that may have a large economic or investment potential, in particular for SMEs, e.g. cognitive radio or e-health. Adequate protection against harmful interference should also be ensured to sustain R&D and scientific activities.
