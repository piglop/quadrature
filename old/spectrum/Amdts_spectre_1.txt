(1) Article 8a(3) of the Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive)3 provides that the Commission may submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and Council for establishing multiannual radio spectrum policy programmes setting out policy orientations and objectives for the strategic planning and harmonisation of the use of spectrum in accordance with the directives applicable to electronic communications networks and services. These policy orientations and objectives should refer to the availability and efficient use of spectrum necessary for the establishment and functioning of the internal market. This Decision is without prejudice to existing EU law, in particular Directives 1999/5/EC and Directives 2002/20/EC and 2002/21/EC, as well as Decision No 676/2002/EC. It is also without prejudice to measures taken at national level, in compliance with EU law, to pursue general interest objectives, in particular relating to content regulation and audio-visual policy and to the right of Member States to organise and use their spectrum for public order and public security purposes and defence.

(2) Spectrum is a key resource for essential sectors and services, including mobile, wireless broadband and satellite communications, television and radio broadcasting, transport, radiolocation, and applications such as alarm, remote controls, hearing aids, microphones, and medical equipment. It supports public services such as security and safety services, including civil protection, and scientific activities, such as meteorology, Earth observation, radio astronomy and space research. Regulatory measures on spectrum therefore have economic, safety, health, public interest, cultural, scientific, social, environmental and technical implications.

(3) The strategic planning and harmonisation of spectrum use at Union level should enhance the single market for wireless electronic communications services and equipment as well as other Union policies requiring spectrum use, thus creating new opportunities for innovation and contributing to economic recovery and social integration across the Union, while at the same time respecting the important social, cultural and economic value of spectrum. To this end, the Union therefore needs a policy programme that covers the internal market in all Union policy areas involving the use of spectrum such as electronic communications, research and development, transport and energy.

The harmonisation of spectrum use is also essential to ensure the quality of the services provided by electronic communications and to create economies of scale lowering both the cost of deploying wireless networks and the cost of wireless devices for consumers. To this end, the Union therefore needs a policy programme that covers the internal market in all Union policy areas involving the use of spectrum such as electronic communications, research and development, transport and energy.

(4) This first programme should in particular support the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth given the huge potential of wireless services to promote an information-based economy, develop and assist sectors relying on information and communications technologies and overcome the digital divide. It is also a key action in the Digital Agenda for Europe4 which aims to deliver fast broadband internet in the future network-based knowledge economy, with an ambitious target for universal broadband coverage with speeds of at least 30 Mbps for all Europeans by 2020, thereby achieving the sustainable economic and social benefits of a digital single market. It should also support and promote other Union sectoral policies such as a sustainable environment and economic and social inclusion for all Union citizens. Given the importance of wireless applications for innovation, this programme is also a key initiative in support of Union policies on innovation.

It is also a key action in the Digital Agenda for Europe4 which aims to deliver fast broadband internet in the future network-based knowledge economy, with an ambitious target for universal broadband coverage. Providing the highest possible broadband speeds and capacity, ensuring not less than 30 Mbps for all by 2020 with at least half of European households having broadband access at a speed of at least 100 Mbps, is important for fostering economic growth and global competitiveness, thereby achieving the sustainable economic and social benefits of a digital single market. It should also support and promote other Union sectoral policies such as a sustainable environment and economic and social inclusion for all Union citizens. Given the importance of wireless applications for innovation, this programme is also a key initiative in support of Union policies on innovation. At the same time (Digital) Terrestrial broadcasting remains the largest and most preferred TV distribution platform, both for Commercial and Public Service Free-to-Air TV (circa 60% of European households pick their primary TV signal from terrestrial broadcasting), and in many countries, is complemented by strong pay TV offerings. For this reason the Commission and Member States should take into account the unique technological, economic and societal benefits of terrestrial broadcasting when formulating the RSPP. Terrestrial broadcasting underpins media plurality and is a force for public good. It is currently the main guarantor of universal access to television, at a minimal cost, across Europe. It is universally available to European consumers across the EU and is the consumers' choice. Demand for linear TV is growing and not decreasing. Viewing habits for many European citizens have not changed and the overwhelming majority of viewing remains via linear television. Moreover in recent years, consumers have invested significantly into digital terrestrial TV equipment.

(7) Ensuring the optimal use of spectrum may require innovative authorisation solutions such as collective use of spectrum, general authorisations or infrastructure sharing. The application of such principles in the Union might be facilitated by the definition of certain common or converging conditions for spectrum usage. General authorisations, which are the least onerous authorisation system, are of particular interest where interference does not risk hampering the development of other services.

(8) Spectrum rights trading combined with flexible usage conditions should substantially benefit economic growth. Therefore, bands where flexible use has already been introduced by Union law should be immediately made tradable pursuant to the Framework Directive.

(9) As underlined in the Digital Agenda for Europe, wireless broadband is an important means to boost competition, consumer choice and access in rural and other areas where deployment of wired broadband is difficult or economically unviable. However, spectrum management may affect competition by changing the role and power of market players, for example if existing users receive undue competitive advantages. Limited spectrum access, in particular when appropriate spectrum becomes scarcer, can create a barrier to entry for new services or applications and hamper innovation and competition. Acquisition of new usage rights, including through spectrum trading or other transactions between users, and the introduction of new flexible criteria for spectrum use can have an impact on the existing competitive situation. Member States should therefore take appropriate ex ante or ex post regulatory measures (such as action to amend existing rights, to prohibit certain acquisitions of spectrum rights, to impose conditions on spectrum hoarding and efficient use such as those referred to in Article 9 paragraph 7 of the Framework Directive, to limit the amount of spectrum for each operator, or to avoid excessive accumulation of spectrum) to avoid distortions of competition in line with the principles underpinning Article 5(6) of Directive 2002/20/EC (the ‘Authorisation’ Directive) and Article 1(2) of Directive 87/372/EEC (the ‘GSM’ Directive).

However, spectrum management may affect competition by changing the role and power of market players, for example if existing users receive undue competitive advantages. Therefore, the award conditions shall ensure fair competition to ensure broadband communications in regions while new entrants shall not be prevented from the market entry. Also, new technologies should not be discriminated just because they are later available on the market. Limited spectrum access, in particular when appropriate spectrum becomes scarcer, can create a barrier to entry for new services or applications and hamper innovation and competition.

(10) Optimal and efficient spectrum use requires continuous monitoring of developments, and up-to-date transparent information on spectrum use throughout the Union. While Commission Decision 2007/344/EC on harmonised availability of information regarding spectrum use within the Community6 requires Member States to publish information on usage rights, a detailed inventory of existing spectrum use together with an effective review and assessment methodology are necessary in the Union to improve the efficiency of spectrum and radio equipment use, in particular between 300 MHz and 3 GHz. This would help to identify inefficient technologies and usages in both the commercial and public sectors, as well as unused assignments and sharing opportunities, and to evaluate future consumer and business needs.

European standards for non-radio electric and electronic equipment and networks should also avoid disturbance to spectrum use. The cumulative impact of the increasing volume and density of wireless devices and applications combined with the diversity of spectrum use challenges current approaches to interference management. These should be examined and reassessed together with receiver characteristics and more sophisticated interference avoidance mechanisms.

(11a) New Long-Term Evolution (LTE) broadband mobile communications networks are being rolled out in various Member States. Those networks use the 790-862 MHz frequency band. Some radio microphones currently operate in that band, possibly causing interference. This may also concern devices operated in schools, theatres and conference venues or by other commercial, public or private users. The requisite technical retrofitting will be achievable only with considerable financial outlay, and it is imperative to clarify where responsibility lies in this connection.

(12a) According to multiple converging studies, mobile data traffic is increasing rapidly and is currently being doubled every year. With this pace, which is likely to continue in the next coming years, mobile data traffic will have increased nearly 40 times from 2009 to 2014. In order to manage this exponential growth, a number of actions will be required by regulators and market players including increased spectrum efficiency across the board, possible further harmonised spectrum allocations for wireless broadband, and traffic offload onto other networks via multi-mode devices.

(13) The 800 MHz band is optimal for the coverage of large areas by wireless broadband services. Building on the harmonisation of technical conditions under Decision 2010/267/EU, and on Commission Recommendation of 28 October 2009 calling for analogue broadcasting to be switched off by 1 January 2012, and given rapid national regulatory developments, this band should in principle be made available for electronic communications in the Union by 2013. In the longer term, additional spectrum below 790 MHz could also be envisaged, depending on experience and the lack of spectrum in other bands adequate for coverage. Considering the capacity of the 800 MHz band to transmit over large areas, coverage obligations should be attached to rights.

Further mobile service spectrum allocations, such as the 700 MHz band (694-790 MHz), should be evaluated depending on future capacity requirements for wireless broadband services and terrestrial TV.

Building on the harmonisation of technical conditions under Decision 2010/267/EU, and on Commission Recommendation of 28 October 2009 calling for analogue broadcasting to be switched off by 1 January 2012, and given rapid national regulatory developments, this band should in principle be made available for electronic communications in the Union by 2013.

Building on the harmonisation of technical conditions under Decision 2010/267/EU, and on Commission Recommendation of 28 October 2009 calling for analogue broadcasting to be switched off by 1 January 2012, and given rapid national regulatory developments, this band should in principle be made available for electronic communications in the Union by 2013. In the longer term, additional spectrum below 790 MHz could also be envisaged, depending on experience and the lack of spectrum in other bands adequate for coverage. Considering the capacity of the 800 MHz band to transmit over large areas, coverage obligations should be attached to rights.
(13) The 800 MHz band can be used, for example, for the coverage of large areas by wireless broadband services. Building on the harmonisation of technical conditions under Decision 2010/267/EU, and on Commission Recommendation of 28 October 2009 calling for analogue broadcasting to be switched off by 1 January 2012, and given rapid national regulatory developments, this band should in principle be made available for electronic communications in the Union as soon as feasible. In the longer term, the use of the entire radio spectrum range could be reviewed, depending on actual market demands plus social and cultural objectives. Furthermore, consumers and the broadcasting industry are now making substantial efforts and investments in clearing the 800 MHz band. Consequently, no additional change of use should be considered for the remaining broadcast spectrum.

(13a) Commission Decision 2010/267/EU designated the 800 MHz band for terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communication services leaving the Member States to decide individually whether and at what point in time to designate or make available the 800 MHz band for such systems. Nevertheless, with a view to achieving the targets for broadband coverage set up by the Europe 2020 Strategy, the introduction of a deadline for making available the 800 MHz band for systems capable of providing electronic communication services may be needed.

(13a) Increased mobile broadband opportunities may provide the cultural sector with new distribution platforms, thereby paving the way for a future development of the sector. It is essential that terrestrial broadcasting services and other actors be able to develop their services when additional part of the spectrum is freed up for wireless services. Member States should grant appropriate compensation to existing users for migration costs, resulting from the opening up of additional spectrum.

(13b) It has to be acknowledged that fixing of any obligatory deadline for making available the 800 Mhz band for terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communication services could have direct implications on the organisation of the use of the band for general interest objectives or public security and defence purposes in some Member States. Furthermore, the optimal use of 800 MHz band may be impeded in cases where third countries have decided on different uses that cause harmful interference in some Member States and prevent them from efficient use of the 800 MHz band for systems capable of providing electronic communication services on their whole territory or on a part of it. In such cases the deadline to be set up in the present Decision for implementation of Commission Decision 2010/267/EU may need to be postponed in some Member States.

Optimising synergies between spectrum policy and R&D activities and carrying out studies of radio compatibility between different spectrum users should help innovation. The Commission's Joint Research Centre should help in developing the technical aspects of spectrum regulation, notably by providing testing facilities to verify interference models relevant to Union legislation. Moreover, results of research under the Seventh Framework Programme require the examination of the spectrum needs of projects that may have a large economic or investment potential, in particular for SMEs, e.g. cognitive radio or e-health. Adequate protection against harmful interference should also be ensured to sustain R&D and scientific activities.
