Text proposed by the Commission
Amendment

3a. The Commission, in cooperation with Member States, is invited to take action at the appropriate levels to achieve the further harmonisation and more efficient use across the Union of the 1.5 GHz band (1452-1492 MHz), a band already shared between satellite and terrestrial use, and the 2.3 GHz band (2300-2400 MHz) for wireless broadband services. The Commission shall continuously monitor the capacity requirements for wireless broadband services and when justified, in cooperation with Member States, evaluate the need for action to harmonise additional spectrum bands, such as the 700 MHz band (694-790 MHz) in support of the increasing demand for mobile broadband services due primarily to audiovisual content. Such further harmonisation shall be without prejudice to the technological solutions that may be adopted across the Union and shall ensure a level playing field between different technological solutions and support the emergence of pan-European operators within the Union.
