(4) This first programme should in particular support the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth given the huge potential of wireless services to promote an information-based economy, develop and assist sectors relying on information and communications technologies and overcome the digital divide. It is also a key action in the Digital Agenda for Europe which aims to deliver fast broadband internet in the future network-based knowledge economy, with an ambitious target for universal broadband '''coverage''' '''with''' speeds '''of''' '''at''' '''least''' 30 Mbps for all '''Europeans '''by '''2020,''' thereby achieving the sustainable economic and social benefits of a digital single market. It should also support and promote other Union sectoral policies such as a sustainable environment and economic and social inclusion for all Union citizens. Given the importance of wireless applications for innovation, this programme is also a key initiative in support of Union policies on innovation.

(7) Ensuring the optimal use of spectrum may require innovative authorisation solutions such as collective use of spectrum, general '''authorisations''' or infrastructure sharing. The application of such principles in the Union might be facilitated by the definition of certain common or converging conditions for spectrum usage. General authorisations, which are the least onerous authorisation system, are of particular interest where interference does not risk hampering the development of other services.

(9) As underlined in the Digital Agenda for Europe, wireless broadband is an important means to boost competition, consumer choice and access in rural and other areas where deployment of wired broadband is difficult or economically unviable. However, spectrum management may affect competition by changing the role and power of market players, for example if existing users receive undue competitive advantages. Limited spectrum access, in particular when appropriate spectrum becomes scarcer, can create a barrier to entry for new services or applications and hamper innovation and competition. Acquisition of new usage rights, including through spectrum trading or other transactions between users, and the introduction of new flexible criteria for spectrum use can have an impact on the existing competitive situation. Member States should therefore take appropriate ex ante or ex post regulatory measures (such as action to amend existing rights, to prohibit certain acquisitions of spectrum rights, to impose conditions on spectrum hoarding and efficient use such as those referred to in Article 9 paragraph 7 of the Framework Directive, to limit the amount of spectrum for each operator, or to avoid excessive accumulation of spectrum) to avoid distortions of competition in line with the principles underpinning Article 5(6) of Directive 2002/20/EC (the "Authorisation" Directive) and Article 1(2) of Directive 87/372/EEC (the "GSM" Directive).

(10) Optimal and efficient spectrum use requires continuous monitoring of developments, and up-to-date transparent information on spectrum use throughout the Union. While Commission Decision 2007/344/EC on harmonised availability of information regarding spectrum use within the Community requires Member States to publish information on usage rights, a detailed inventory of existing spectrum use together with an effective review and assessment methodology are necessary in the Union to improve the efficiency of spectrum and radio equipment use, in particular between 300 MHz and '''3''' '''GHz.''' This would help to identify inefficient technologies and usages in both the commercial and public sectors, as well as unused assignments and sharing opportunities, and to evaluate future consumer and business needs.

(12) In line with the objectives of the Commission's flagship initiative "Digital Agenda for Europe", wireless broadband '''could''' contribute substantially to economic recovery and growth if sufficient spectrum is made available, usage rights are awarded quickly and trading is allowed to adapt to market evolution. The Digital Agenda calls for all Union citizens to have access to broadband of at least 30 Mbps by 2020. Therefore, spectrum that has already been '''designated''' should be authorised by 2012 for terrestrial communications to ensure easy access to wireless broadband for all, in particular within spectrum bands designated by Commission Decisions 2008/477/EC, 2008/411/EC and 2009/766/EC. To complement terrestrial broadband services and ensure coverage of most remote Union areas, affordable satellite broadband access could be a fast and feasible solution.

At this pace, which is likely to continue in the coming years, mobile data traffic will have increased nearly 40-fold from 2009 to 2014. This increase is to a high extent being driven by video, which will account for 66% of all mobile traffic in 2014. In order to manage this exponential growth, a number of actions will be required by regulators and market players including further harmonised spectrum allocations for wireless broadband, increased spectrum efficiency and offloading traffic onto wireless networks via dual-use devices .'''

Reflecting the importance of spectrum trading for increasing efficient use of '''spectrum''' and developing the internal market for wireless equipment and services, these conditions should apply to spectrum bands that are allocated to wireless communications, and for which rights of use may be transferred or leased.

At the same time (Digital) Terrestrial broadcasting remains the largest and most preferred TV distribution platform, both for Commercial and Public Service Free-to-Air TV (circa 60% of European households pick their primary TV signal from terrestrial broadcasting), and in many countries, is complemented by strong pay TV offerings. For this reason the Commission and Member States should take into account the unique technological, economic and societal benefits of terrestrial broadcasting when formulating the RSPP. Terrestrial broadcasting underpins media plurality and is a force for public good. It is currently the main guarantor of universal access to television, at a minimal cost, across Europe. It is universally available to European consumers across the EU and is the consumers' choice. Demand for linear TV is growing and not decreasing. Viewing habits for many European citizens have not changed and the overwhelming majority of viewing remains via linear television. Moreover in recent years, consumers have invested significantly into digital terrestrial TV equipment.'''

(8) Spectrum rights trading combined with flexible usage conditions should substantially benefit economic growth.''' Therefore, bands where flexible use has already been introduced by Union law should be immediately made tradable pursuant to the Framework Directive.''' In addition, common principles for the format and content of such tradable rights as well as common measures to prevent accumulation of spectrum which may create dominant positions as well as undue failure to use acquired spectrum, would facilitate the coordinated introduction by all Member States of these measures and facilitate acquisition of such rights anywhere in the Union.

(9) As underlined in the Digital Agenda for Europe, wireless broadband is an important means to boost competition, consumer choice and access in rural and other areas where deployment of wired broadband is difficult or economically unviable. However, spectrum management may affect competition by changing the role and power of market players, for example if existing users receive undue competitive advantages. Limited spectrum access, in particular when appropriate spectrum becomes scarcer, can create a barrier to entry for new services or applications and hamper innovation and competition. Acquisition of new usage rights, including through spectrum trading or other transactions between users, and the introduction of new flexible criteria for spectrum use can have an impact on the existing competitive situation. Member States should therefore take appropriate ex ante or ex post regulatory measures (such as action to amend existing rights, to prohibit certain acquisitions of spectrum rights, to impose conditions on spectrum hoarding and efficient use such as those referred to in Article 9 paragraph 7 of the Framework Directive, to limit the amount of spectrum for each operator, or to avoid excessive accumulation of spectrum) to avoid distortions of competition in line with the principles underpinning Article 5(6) of Directive 2002/20/EC (the ‘Authorisation’ Directive) and Article 1(2) of Directive 87/372/EEC (the ‘GSM’ Directive).

(11) Harmonised standards under Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity7 are essential to achieve efficient spectrum use and should take account of legally defined sharing conditions. European standards for non-radio electric and electronic equipment and networks should also avoid disturbance to spectrum use. The cumulative impact of the increasing volume and density of wireless devices and applications combined with the diversity of spectrum use challenges current approaches to interference management. These should be examined and reassessed together with receiver characteristics and more sophisticated interference avoidance '''mechanisms.'''

'''(11a) New Long-Term Evolution (LTE) broadband mobile communications networks are being rolled out in various Member States. Those networks use the 790-862 MHz frequency band. Some radio microphones currently operate in that band, possibly causing interference. This may also concern devices operated in schools, theatres and conference venues or by other commercial, public or private users. The requisite technical retrofitting will be achievable only with considerable financial outlay, and it is imperative to clarify where responsibility lies in this connection.'''

With this pace, which is likely to continue in the next coming years, mobile data traffic will have increased nearly 40 times from 2009 to 2014. In order to manage this exponential growth, a number of actions will be required by regulators and market players including increased spectrum efficiency across the board, possible further harmonised spectrum allocations for wireless broadband, and traffic offload onto other networks via multi-mode devices.'''

(18) Essential public interest objectives such as safety of life call for coordinated technical solutions for the interworking of safety and emergency services between Member States. Sufficient spectrum should be made available on a coherent basis for the development and free circulation of safety services and devices and innovative pan-European or interoperable safety and emergency solutions. Studies have already shown the need for additional harmonised spectrum below 1 GHz to deliver mobile broadband services for public protection and disaster relief, across the Union in the next 5 to 10 years.

(19) Spectrum regulation has strong cross-border or international dimensions, due to propagation characteristics, the international nature of markets dependent on radio-based services, and the need to avoid harmful interference between countries. Moreover, the references to international agreements in Directives 2002/21/EC and 2002/20/EC as amended8 means that Member States shall not enter into international obligations that prevent or constrain the fulfilment of their Union obligations. Member States should, in accordance with the case-law, undertake all necessary efforts to enable appropriate representation of the Union in matters under its competence in international bodies in charge of spectrum coordination. Moreover, where Union policy or competence is at stake, the Union should politically drive the preparation of negotiations and '''play''' '''a''' '''role''' in multilateral '''negotiations,''' including in the International Telecommunications Union that corresponds to its level of responsibility for spectrum matters under Union law.
