26/09/2011 - Below are the amendments to the Net neutrality [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/itre/dv/08092011_res_net_neutrality_/08092011_res_net_neutrality_en.pdf resolution], currently discussed by the Industry, Transport, Research, Energy [http://www.laquadrature.net/wiki/MEPs_ITRE committee] of the EU Paliament. So far, the draft resolution is very weak, and play into the hands of telecom operators, who are lobbying hard to make it worse.
