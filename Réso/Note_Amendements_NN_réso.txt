<Amend>

Comment: Dangerous redaction. Ill-defined term regarding “pay-for-priorisation”, which is incompatible with a neutral Internet. If the term refers to “managed services”, then better amendments in this regard. Any reference to managed services should draw a clear distinction with the Internet. That being said, the overall goal to have strong minimum QoS requirements is of course laudable.
