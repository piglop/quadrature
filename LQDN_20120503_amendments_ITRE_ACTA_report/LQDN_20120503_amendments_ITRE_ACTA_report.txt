4a. Recalls that when dealing with the nature of IPR infringements, the European Parliament has underlined the importance of the principle of proportionality1; is therefore concerned by the fact that ACTA draws no distinction between infringements committed on a commercial scale, and infringements carried out by private users for personal and not-for-profit purposes; believes moreover that ACTA would freeze the possibility for the EP to modify in the future EU IPR legislation, while a review of the IPR Enforcement Directive (IPRED) is foreseen in the next coming months.

4a. Expresses serious concerns about copyright enforcement online, especially the obligation to apply criminal sanctions, without the necessary provision of binding safeguards for personal users, as well as the vague definition of terms, particularly with reference to the concept of "commercial use". For example, in Art. 14, point 2, the countries agree that "a party may exclude from the application of [...] small quantities of goods of a non-commercial nature contained in travellers’ personal luggage", which means also that a party may decide not to exclude small quantities such goods, raising serious concerns about possible infringements of the free movement of goods and persons within EU.
